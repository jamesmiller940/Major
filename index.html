            <h2>The Architecture of Inquiry</h2>
            <p>Choosing a major is often framed as a vocational pipeline. However, at Duke Kunshan, we view a major as a <strong>mode of inquiry</strong>—a specialized lens through which you learn to decompose complexity and analyze evidence.</p>
            <p>This tool identifies the underlying intellectual architecture of your mind. It does not measure what you want to "be," but rather <strong>how you naturally prefer to solve an unsolved problem.</strong></p>
            <p>You will be presented with 15 randomized research scenarios. For each, identify the methodological approach that resonates most deeply with your curiosity.</p>

            <h3>Method over Major</h3>
